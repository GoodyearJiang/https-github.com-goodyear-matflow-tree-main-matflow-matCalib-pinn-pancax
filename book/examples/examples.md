# Examples
All examples require writing a python script (or jupyter notebook if that is your preference) and at the minimum having the below line.

```python
from pancax import *
```

This will bring in all of the well tested and most used portions of the pancax codebase. There may be in development portions of the code that require more complex import statements.
