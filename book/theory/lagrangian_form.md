# Lagrangian Form
The Lagrangian is given by the difference of the kinetic and potential energy,
$$
L = T - V,
$$
where for a continuum occupying a domain $\Omega$ we have
$$
T = \int_\Omega \frac{1}{2}\rho\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v}d\Omega
$$
and $V$ is problem dependent. For the quasi-static limit we can assume $T << V$ and $L \approx -V$
